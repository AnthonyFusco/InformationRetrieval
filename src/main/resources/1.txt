John Cleese has declared he is voting for Britain to leave the EU and suggested killing European Commission President Jearn-Claude Juncker would be the best way of reforming the bloc.

The Fawlty Towers and Monty Python star made his views on the EU referendum clear in a series of tweets last night. 

He accused Mr Juncker of 'threatening' Britain and branded David Cameron's attempts at reform a failure as he plumped for an out vote on June 23. 

Cleese said Britain had been 'swimming against the tide' in its bid to bring about change in Brussels, where bureaucrats had taken away 'any trace of democratic accountability'.

The prominent Liberal Democrat supporter said it was a 'sad' situation and appeared to address his message to party grandee Lord [Paddy] Ashdown, who is campaigning for Remain.

'If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU, I'd vote to stay in. But there isn't. Sad. Sorry, Paddy,' he tweeted on Saturday.

Among the EU reforms suggested by the Monty Python star were 'give up the Euro, introduce accountability,and hang Jean-Claude Juncker'.

His pro-EU followers disagreed, with James Burns tweeting: '@JohnCleese Economically, we are better IN, according to the IMF, OECD, IFS, Bank of England, 90% of surveyed economies.'

Luke Reid said: '@JohnCleese It would be terrible to vote for democracy and sovereignty!!!!'
