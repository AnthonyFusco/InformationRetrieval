For the UK? Considering we have not left yet, it is already very bad - and it will get worse.

    Sterling (often viewed as the market�s view of �the health of a country�) is at the lowest level for 30 years
    UK has lost its AAA credit rating
    The number of jobs advertised has dropped by 700,000
    The economic forecasts vary between a drop, through to outright recession. Especially negative because 1H2016 (before the vote) was looking very good.
    Companies are pausing or cancelling investments
    Pensions will be clobbered: pensions are now worth �115billion less than pre-Brexit
    Brexit�s Biggest Fans Face New 115 Billion-Pound Pension Hole
    The stock market has dropped markedly. (The fall in sterling hides this for FTSE100 but for the companies exposed to UK it is severe)
    And that shows up in shares prices of banks, building companies - with several funds announcing they have �frozen�: suspended investments and withdrawals.
    Racist attacks & hate crimes have risen 500% since Brexit vote - and yes, there are linked.
    Post-Brexit racism: Five times as many hate crimes reported since EU vote
    Property prices in London have dropped.
    VC investment has dropped markedly, and lots of startups are planning on moving
    Science funding has already been hurt, and lots of projects cancelled.
    It has become clear to LEAVE ministers that their claims were (cough) over-optimistic. eg US Spurns offer of trade talks.
    Not surprising because:
    a) We can�t legally negotiate until we leave EU
    b) We do not have Civil Servants with the experience to negotiate these deals, so we need to recruit them
    c) We can�t even have meaningful negotiations with USA etc until we know what terms we will have with EU (because these deals all interlock & inter-relate)

    As the US trade negator said �meaningful negotiations with UK are impossible until UK has actually left EU� - which will not be until 2019
    and that the US top priority was to conclude their deal with EU

And, remember we haven�t even left yet. This is a foretaste of what will happen if we do.

I am struggling to think of any decision in Britain as disastrous as this.
